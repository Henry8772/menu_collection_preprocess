Chinese cuisine has a long and rich history, Sichuan 四川 can 
boast to be one of the ‘Four Great Taste of China’. Sichuan is a 
province in South West China and due to its geographical location, 
it is also known by the Chinese as the Province of Abundance.
There are over 6,000 Sichuan dishes. The food of Sichuan is 
diverse as it is popular. In 2011, UNESCO* declared Chengdu, the 
capital of Sichuan to be The City of Gastronomy, recognising 
Sichuan cuisine as well as the sophistication and finesse of 
Sichuan Cooking.
There is a misconception that Sichuan food is simply numbing hot, 
made famous by the tingling sensation of the Sichuan Pepper 花椒
Sichuan food is not just about the taste of chilli heat, there are 
complex and contrasting flavours of sweet and sour, spicy and 
sour, spicy and sweet, fermented sweetness and mellow spiciness.
As you read through our menu, you will come across strangely 
named flavours such as, ‘fish fragrant flavour’ 魚香, ‘home style 
flavour’ 家常, ‘numbing and hot flavour’ 麻辣, ‘red oil flavour (chilli 
oil)’ 红油, ‘sour and hot’ 酸辣, and ‘spicy salt and Sichuan pepper’ 
椒鹽.
Each dish is unique. Let your palate explore
